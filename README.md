# Kosha Freshdesk Connector

Freshdesk is a cloud-based customer support platform that was founded with the mission of enabling companies of all sizes to provide great customer service.

The connector APIs allow you to perform 'RESTful' operations such as reading, modifying, adding or deleting data from your helpdesk. The APIs also support Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

This Connector API exposes REST API endpoints to perform any operations on Freshdesk v2 API in a simple, quick and intuitive fashion.

It describes various API operations, related request and response structures, and error codes.
